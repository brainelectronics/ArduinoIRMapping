# ArduinoIRMapping
moves a IR sensor around and builds a map out of the values

use two servo motors and a sharp ir sensor to map the surface around you.
The surface will be displayed as "0" (free) or "1" (blocked) on the serial monitor

TBD:
Use a python script to show the map instead of the terminal view
