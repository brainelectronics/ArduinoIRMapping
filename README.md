# ArduinoIRMapping
moves a IR sensor around and builds a grey scaled "image" out of the distances

use two servo motors and a IR sensor to map the surface around you.
The surface will be displayed as white (free) or up to black (blocked) on the pygame window

TBD:
ensure that all values are received and convertable
